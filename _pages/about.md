My personal blog where I share my insights about technology, productivity, and books. I'm an avid reader and have read most of my share of books during my college days. I'm often fascinated by the value people are able to create by doing simple things in effective ways. I started blogging back in 2017 and posted a few blogs on my [Wordpress][wordpress] site, some of those blogs were later re-published on sites like [Hacker Noon][hackernoon], [Medium][medium], and [GeeksforGeeks][gfg]. 

A lot of these blogs have been read by over 200,000 people from around the globe. Although I like publishing on other platforms, I often found it difficult to control the distribution of my content. This website is an attempt to resolve all that. You will find some of my previous content here along with some new ones. 

So if you want to learn more, you can consider subscribing to my RSS feed using an RSS reader like [Feedly][feedly]. I'll be exploring some newer technologies, productivity habits, and ideas from books in this blog. 

## About me
