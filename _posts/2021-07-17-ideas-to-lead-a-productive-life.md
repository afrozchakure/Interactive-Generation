### The Law's of Productivity 

You may have heard about different laws in Physics and Chemistry, but do you know some of the famous laws for increasing productivity. Below I have listed just of few of such laws that can help you lead a productive life.  

A lot of these have been adopted in the world of business and technology to increase sales and productivity for an employee, employer, customer or Leader. You would find there widespread adoption by UI and UX experts while building mobile and web technologies. 

### 1. Zeigarnik Effect : 

The Zeigarnik effect was first stated by Sovient psychologist Dr. Bluma Zeigarnik in 1927. 

> Our minds quickly forget finished tasks. However, they are programmed to continually interrupt us with reminders of unfinished tasks. These intrusions constitue the Zeigarnik Effect. 

Simply put, Zeigarnik Effect is the ability of our brain to remember tasks that we haven't completed.

#### Use in business: 
Zeigarnik effect is widely used in creating forms to onboard users faster. The completion bar in an empty form denoting form completion percentage is a good example of Zeigarnik Effect.

### 2. Pareto principle or 80 / 20 principle: 

First coined by Italian echonomist Vilfredo Pareto, The Pareto principle states that for many results, 

> Roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes. 

The pareto principle is a key principle in business and technology as it shows the disparity between effort and results. 

Originally the principle was used by Vilfredo to show that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the people. The same principle can be used to compare sales' figures of companies, funding and dissolution of startups, comparing placement records of colleges, salaries of players in sports and so on.

#### Use in calculating Revenue:
For example: Google makes nearly 80% of its revenues from Google ads and 20% from its core business. While the priciple may not apply exactly 80-20, for most cases 70-30 or 60-40 is more commonly used.

Even though Google is known for a lot of its services like Android and Google Cloud, we seem to forget the gazillion of trackers google has put up on the internet, all trying to __hopefully__ fulfill peoples' wants to get paid for their content online. 

### 3. Parkinson's law: 

Originally coined by Cyril Parkinson in an essay later reprinted in his book "Parkinson's Law: The Pursuit of Progress", the law states that 

> Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.

Ever wondered why you were able to complete an assignment which would have taken months to do research on in a short time? 

The answer is the Parkinson law. It is one of those "Experienced by many, understood by none" situations that faces many of us in our daily lives.

#### Use in technology:

Parkinson's law is popularly applied in computer industry, 

> for example:  "Data expands to fill the space available or storage", 

The above seems obvious considering all the useless data software companies fill up their data centers with.

It is an important law which tells us the importance 

### 4. Murphy's Law: 

Ever wondered why your Chemistry teacher said to always prepare for the worst in a chemical reaction. He probably wanted to refer to the Murphy's Law. Murphy's law states that 

> "Everything that can go wrong, will go wrong". 



### 5. Yhprum's law: 

> Opposite of Murphy's law, Everything that can work, will work

### 6.
