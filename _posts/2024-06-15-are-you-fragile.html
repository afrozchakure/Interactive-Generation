<h4>How much Money &amp; Power will make you do anything for anyone &amp; to anyone ?</h4><p>If I give you Rs 1 crore, will you do anything for me?</p><p>Does it seems too small an amount, what about Rs 100 crores will you be willing to sell your soul to the devil?</p><p>Many will and many did in the last many years.</p><p>The number of <strong>people who “sold-out” actually has increased exponentially.</strong></p><h4>What have we done to/for our Youth?</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*Ic1auif4kRmL1z71KNLUgg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@flyd2069?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">FlyD</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/text-s56H08cAlM0?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><ol><li>The rise of frantic Youtubers doing dangerous stunts just to get views, fame and money.

And yes,<strong> many of these exam papers get leaked</strong>, thanks to “partnership between those in the government and paper-leak mafias”.</li><li>Some will prefer changing countries to study outside &amp; in search of good lifestyle &amp; jobs while <strong>many will elect “uneducated criminals” in their own home country ruining the lives of other people</strong>. <strong>The same individuals will be called “Outsiders”</strong> by lunatics when they make logical arguments against the regime.</li><li>People joining IT cells of political parties just because they get paid Rs 2 to Rs 3 per tweet or per comment promoting a particular ideology.</li><li>Rise of cult organizations because People are ready to join in the name of religion and mental health.</li><li>The rise in polarization leading to many joining militant organization sponsored by Political parties just because it’s better to do something than remain jobless even after a College Degree.</li><li>High inflation and Low employment opportunities making life difficult for middle class.</li></ol><p>We have forced our youth to do these things because in the name of development, education and healthcare we haven’t done anything and given them anything.</p><h4>How long will you blame the Past? — Question the Present Leaders</h4><p>People today don’t really take responsibility for what happens in the world because of their decisions.</p><p>In the old times, when there used to be a train accident, union ministers used to resign from their roles<strong> citing their fault and negligence in the whole matter.</strong></p><p>There was a time <strong>when any allegation was raised against someone in power or raised against their relatives they were the first ones to resign</strong>.</p><p>You don’t see that today.</p><p>Yes, today some of them will cry on National Television, saying how bad they feel about the lives lost but <strong>they’ll continue in their roles of Power.</strong></p><blockquote>Those who want Power want to keep that Power forever!</blockquote><h4>People have become blind followers</h4><p>You want to know how to win elections the easy way?</p><p>Don’t talk about your plans for Development, Education, Healthcare or even Women safety.</p><p>Here’s an algorithm that will help you bypass everything:</p><ol><li><strong>Become a torch bearer of religion.</strong></li><li><strong>Create a narrative about your Supreme leader</strong> telling how he is ‘one in a Billion’, tell everyone there is no opposition and say if not him then who?</li><li>Tell people that ‘<strong>Your religion is in Danger</strong>’. It hadn’t been in Danger for the last 70 years before we came to power but yes who’s counting :D</li><li>Propagate the same messages through the national media, WhatsApp, Instagram reels, and Twitter every day.
