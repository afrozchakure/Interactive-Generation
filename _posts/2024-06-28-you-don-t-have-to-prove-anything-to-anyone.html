<h4>Constant need for approval and acceptance is a recipe for failure</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*uO6NmUKpy1l0Tn_6-Nb9xA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by Matheus Bertelli: <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/photography-of-a-woman-holding-lights-799420/">https://www.pexels.com/photo/photography-of-a-woman-holding-lights-799420/</a></figcaption></figure><p>A lot of times I feel that people feel the need to prove themselves again and again in this world.</p><p>The idea of reaching perfection is good but the constant need for validating yourself in front of others and by others again &amp; again is never healthy.</p><blockquote>People will judge you by your past, your present and your potential future.</blockquote><p>The world at large is crazy — Nepotism, Unequality and Unfairness run large in this world. You have to accept it as it is because fighting it is vain.</p><blockquote>You might not get anything or everything you want in this world.</blockquote><h4>Do it for Yourself</h4><p>This I learnt in my college, many students came there just because their parents forced them to join and not because they wanted to study &amp; make something of themselves.</p><blockquote>In life, achievements will not have any value if you don’t want it &amp; haven’t worked hard for it with your heart, mind and body.</blockquote><p>My Chemistry teacher used to say this, “Don’t Study for your parents, siblings, or anyone. Study for Yourself because then it’ll have <strong>some value</strong>.”</p><p>Life has a way of knowing when you are working hard because you want something and when you are working just for the sake of it.</p><blockquote>When everything falls into place and works the way you expect it to work, then the world around you feels like magic.</blockquote><h4>“Comparing yourself to others” is a Recipe for Disaster</h4><p>Former US President Theodore Roosevelt has famously stated, <strong>“Comparison is the thief of joy”.</strong></p><p>The more you try to live a life comparing yourself to others, you will live a life of regrets and anxiety.</p><blockquote>You will always find someone who is more talented, beautiful, famous, richer, happier, taller, stronger, etc. than you.</blockquote><p>That doesn’t mean you don’t have any gifts, it just means <strong>you are unique at what you do!</strong></p><h4>No two lives in this world are similar</h4><p>You’ll never have someone who has had a similar upbringing, lived in a similar environment and seen the things you saw growing up.</p><p>That itself is amazing about the world at large.</p><blockquote>Be confident in what you are deep within because there is not a person in this planet who can be you.</blockquote><blockquote>Embracing and accepting who you are as a person is itself an act of self-determination.</blockquote><p>The modern world has a way of putting Individuals into certain specific Blocks because of <strong>pre-conceived </strong>notions about them.</p><p>You’ve got to break those ideas/barriers by being who you are.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Work hard for things that you have been given.</p><p>You should have large aspirations and ambitions for yourself, Even if others feel like that is too much.</p><blockquote>Always remember, You don’t have to prove anything to anyone but only to Yourself.</blockquote><p>Stay true to this and you’ve conquered the world.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=85c117ebe1ad" width="1" height="1" alt="">
