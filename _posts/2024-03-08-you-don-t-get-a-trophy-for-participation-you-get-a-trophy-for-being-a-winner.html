<p>The modern education system is laughable because it punishes top performers and allows everyone to pass irrespective
    of how much effort they put in.</p>
<p>Let me tell you a story</p>
<h4>How Indian Education System was ruined?</h4>
<p>Initially education was meant as a <strong>pathway to train people to be equipped with the necessary
        knowledge</strong> that would <strong>help them do better at any job of their choosing.</strong></p>
<p>Slowly and gradually <strong>teachers found it difficult to deal with students who were weak at studies</strong> and
    failed &amp; remained in the same class.</p>
<p>To deal with this they <strong>implemented a solution which allowed every student to be promoted to the next grade no
        matter how bad they would’ve performed</strong> in their studies.</p>
<p><strong>Schools didn’t have to deal with low performers</strong> and every student irrespective of how hard they
    studied or how less they studied got promoted.</p>
<p>The <strong>fear of failing vanished, course work &amp; passing exams became easy</strong> and you have an entire
    generation of <strong>people thinking they “Deserve” everything everyone </strong>else has, <strong>irrespective of
        whether they’ve earned it or not.</strong></p>
<h4>Why I hate consolation and participation prizes?</h4>
<p>Although I have received bulk of these during my school and college days, I hate them immensely.</p>
<p>It is still better to lose than to receive these certificates because they essentially mean <strong>“here is a
        certificate just because you exist”</strong>.</p>
<p>These don’t mean <strong>“you are the best”</strong> or <strong>“you performed better than everyone”</strong>.</p>
<p>It <strong>gives a false sense of accomplishment</strong> to all those who have been awarded.</p>
<blockquote>When you award everyone, you are essentially telling the <strong>winners that your efforts &amp; hard-work
        don’t matter </strong>because everyone is equal in our eyes.</blockquote>
<blockquote>When you smudge this all over the winners face — Guess what is going to happen next time, “they won’t
    perform to the best of their abilities”.</blockquote>
<h4>Want Success, Earn it</h4>
<p>The truth is<strong> you don’t deserve shit, everything in life is earned</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if you’ve done great things a few years ago, they don’t matter.</p>
<p>In life<strong> you have to prove yourself each and every day</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>Cracked and secured a good rank in a national or international examination. OR</blockquote>
<blockquote>Did great as an athlete in school and college. OR</blockquote>
<blockquote>Made some great music that did millions of views on Youtube.</blockquote>
<p>These things shouldn’t become our ultimate criteria for choosing the best out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>Some people are late bloomers and success shouldn’t be defined by a single event / act </strong>or
    <strong>have the same pathway as everyone before you</strong>, it is a continuous process of creation and
    achievement.</p>
<p>You certainly shouldn’t be handed the opportunity based on what you did 4 years or even 10 years ago.</p>
<blockquote>Every revolution in history has started off as a fight towards meritocracy but often ends with people at the
    top trying to control and retain power among their own peers and families (leading to monopolies).</blockquote><img
