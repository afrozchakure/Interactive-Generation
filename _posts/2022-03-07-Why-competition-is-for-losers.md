Ever felt the need to compete. We as humans have built ourselves to be faster than ever, stronger than ever, and smarter than ever. But if we slow down, does it mean someone else will get ahead & win, or does it mean that you will lag & lose or even worse both.

Our instinct to make everything a competition not only saved our lives from dangers during pre-historic times but also made sure that we could continue our species.

_Need fire to save yourself from a cold?_

No problem just use the woods from the last remaining tree before the other person.

_Require food?_

Just kill the first animal you can find faster than the other person, or else you will have to look for food elsewhere.

Whether in sports, politics, media, academics, or the professional world‚Ää---‚ÄäEveryone is trying to make everything a competition, not because competition for competition's sake is good but because it helps people select the great from the good and the best from great (At least that is what they say)

### Who gets to decide, who is better among others?

People who were previously seen as greats make rules for the ordinary. These rules get passed down the ages as golden emblems to make sure that no other person gets entry through the golden gate. The rules which were meant to act as keys to freedom become shackles too strong to be broken.

People forget to question the rules and tie themselves to bondages set by other people regardless of how old and absurd those rules are.

### Competition is not fair

Ever wondered why your friend from a prestigious college got that wonderful job offer and you who despite having more or less the same education & an equivalent IQ are stuck in a job with 1/10th his salary. The reason is very simple, **people are forced to reward people who came first**. And the problem is not with you, **the system has been built this way.**

The playing field is not leveled for **everyone**, the disparity in the world will show itself when the competition is over. This disparity can be in terms of money, power, experience, or influence. Competitions in the real world are not made with this in mind.

If you don't reward the person from the prestigious college, there is no point in attending that college. Which in turn makes other students wonder why to pay such high fees and study for those tough exams. Let's be honest, Education is nothing but a piece of paper and hand-load of bills you need to pay to your bank to attain it.

Today it is possible to do all your learning sitting at home and at your own pace, which should make you wonder‚Ää---‚Ääwhy spend all this time, money, and effort on something I can get for free?

### Technology has levelled the playing field

Ten years ago, it wouldn't have been possible for a 13-year-old to earn millions by playing video games sitting at home. But today that is possible thanks to technology. Today a farmer's son is empowered enough to use technology to learn online and get a job at a Salary, educated folks can only dream of.

This advent of the global shift in power is exciting and threatening to a lot of people. **Skills** above Certificates, **Knowledge** above Rank, **Experience** above College Education and **Hard-work** above Degrees are paving the way for the new age of leaders.

### Search for something you are passionate about

For the first time in human history, it is possible to be masters of your world. The traditional 9 to 5 is no longer valid nor needed. People can be content creators, teachers, bloggers, and freelancers without any need for big investments, all thanks to technology.

> The real competition is Time

With your daily chores, it is easy to forget that your time in this world is limited. It is easy for time to fly by working for someone or onto something whether you like it or not. For situations like these, it is important to know your hourly rate. Knowing your hourly rate will tell you whether or not you are getting paid as per your potential and help you figure out better opportunities to improve it.

> Know your Hourly-Rate

Begin your search for a better life with this in mind. As a person trying to make a living, your goal should be to try and maximize your hourly rate.

If you think doing a degree, a course, or learning a new skill is bound to increase your hourly rate given some investment in terms of time and money, feel free to go ahead and do it. But getting into things without any regard for time, effort & money is shooting in the dark.

### Why F.O.M.O. (Fear of Missing out) will ruin your life?

There are services and price for everything in this world. From institutes selling you dreams of getting into a good college to those services promising placements in those high-paying jobs. All of them are a facade. The only people getting rich from them is not you but those selling them.

Instead of getting into such a spiral, start with something a little more basic. [**Ask the 5 Whys?**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys)

The **5 Whys** is an excellent technique to get down to the root cause of the problem and will help you determine if what you are doing is because of F.O.M.O. or whether you want to do it.

People and media will want you to make those decisions in a hurry, but be smart and play the game your way. Because in the end this is your life and you should try to make it a masterpiece.
