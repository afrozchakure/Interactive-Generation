<h4>After effects of Dot-com crash, Financial Crisis and Covid-19 pandemic</h4><h4>Why Gen Zs are the worst hit generation since World War 2</h4><p>Gen Zs might be the worst hit generation in the modern times.</p><p>Most of them are the way they are because of the cards they were dealt with by the modern world.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*ooAfLyUD2Kki9ARm40FeLA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@wildlittlethingsphoto?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Helena Lopes</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/photo-of-three-person-sitting-and-talking-UZe35tk5UoA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Who Is Generation Z (Gen Z) ?</h3><p>Generation Z (often called Gen Z, Zoomers, or post-millennials) is the <strong>second-youngest generation</strong>, with Millennials before and Generation Alpha after.</p><p>Gen Zers were born between the late 1990s and early 2010s.</p><h3>Why Gen Zs are the worst hit generation since World War 2</h3><p>Like millennials in the past who saw the <strong>Dot-com bubble burst</strong> (2000–2002) and <strong>Financial crisis of 2008</strong>,</p><p>Here’s a list of items Gen Zs have had to face since 2019:</p><ol><li>Covid-19 era: 2020 stock market crash, Post-COVID stock market boom.</li><li>Ukraine-Russia war and Israel-Gaza-Iran war.</li><li>Global <strong>high-inflation</strong>, <strong>high fiscal-deficit environment</strong>, mega-stimulus packages injected by government with <strong>high printing of money.</strong></li><li><strong>Crypto boom &amp; busts</strong> with many companies like FTX, Vauld, BlockFi, Gemini trust, etc. declaring bankruptcy.</li><li><strong>Collapse of Banks</strong> like First Republic, Silvergate, Silicon Valley Bank, etc including merger of stressed Credit Suisse with UBS.</li><li><strong>Rise of Right-wing polarization across Europe and the world</strong>, similar to what happened nearly 100 years ago with <strong>Nazi Party (Germany)</strong> and <strong>Republican Fascist Party (Italy)</strong> after the Spanish-flu of 1918.</li><li><strong>High unemployment</strong>, <strong>high education cost </strong>and<strong> student loan debt</strong>, less job security and high lifestyle expenses.</li></ol><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/371/1*04HDVvr_JEhennqd66azDg.png" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@karlahrnndz?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Karla Hernandez</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/3-x-3-rubiks-cube-LrlyZzX6Sws?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><h3>A Generation of Smartphone addicts!</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*RnY2mXM3w_8WWW5g-KIYoA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@erriko_tsg_photographer?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Erriko Boccia</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/person-holding-black-android-smartphone--UjVE1kToZ8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Youngsters today<em> saw most of the world through their smartphones</em>.</p><p>Their opinions, agreements and world-view were formed online using Instagram, Whats App, Twitter, YouTube, Tik-Tok, and Facebook.</p><p>I don’t understand why old generation puts the blame on Gen Zs for <em>what they believe in</em> and <em>how they behave online</em>.</p><p><strong>Most of them never saw an era without Smartphones or PCs</strong> and never lived in a time where <strong>a corporate job meant lifelong service for a single company.</strong></p><p><strong>They didn’t get to choose the period in which they’re born</strong>, neither did they have the free-will like previous generation which didn’t have smartphones.</p><p><strong>Blame the people who created social media, their algorithms and smartphones apps</strong> because they should’ve been the ones to fix these problems.</p><h3>How financial crisis changed everything about corporate world?</h3><p>In the world of finance, <strong>2008 will be remembered as a period of deep pain and fear </strong>around world as we saw the devastating effects of what greed and exuberance can do.</p><p>We had Lehman Brothers, a 150+ years old investment bank fall due to <strong>Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS)</strong> and <strong>Subprime Mortgages</strong>.</p><p>Millions of people got affected due to the crash in Wall Street and around the globe:</p><ol><li>You had <strong>Citi </strong>selling <strong>Smith Barney</strong>, Citi’s global private wealth management unit to <strong>Morgan Stanley</strong>’s Global Wealth Management Group,</li><li><strong>Merrill Lynch </strong>got sold to <strong>Bank of America (BoFA),</strong></li><li>Warren Buffet coming in and injecting billions into <strong>Goldman Sachs</strong> to prevent their Bankruptcy, and</li><li>Government intervening by providing billions of dollars via <strong>Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)</strong> funding to bail-out <a href="https://money.cnn.com/news/specials/storysupplement/bankbailout/">numerous banks</a>.</li></ol><p>Out of these there were many companies which couldn’t be saved. Thousands of people lost their jobs and the trust at <strong>Corporate America was at an all-time low.</strong></p><h4>After effects of financial crisis in the modern world</h4><p>Having witnessed the <em>Dot-com crash, Financial crisis and Covid-19 epidemic</em>, one thing the world will always remember is <em>how fast things change</em>:</p><ol><li>Job security goes down the drain.</li><li>People usually will try to save themselves first.</li><li>Millions of people lost their hard earned money, homes, jobs and investments due to such events.</li><li>How major culprits like board members, politicians, directors &amp; highly paid executives avoided trial &amp; imprisonment.</li><li>Even after taking correct measures, recovery took a lot of time.</li><li>Employees are less trustful of their Employers &amp; absence of right compensation, well-being &amp; benefits affects their tenure at a company.</li></ol><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Gen Zs have seen the previous generation struggle and they themselves have faced such issues.</p><p><strong>They are a lot smarter</strong> about how <em>they approach their life</em>, <em>where they work</em>, <em>how long they work</em> and <em>how they see the world</em>.</p><p>Most of them are <strong>determined, work hard and persevere</strong> when right opportunities present themselves with the right <strong>risk-reward ratio</strong>.</p><p>Gen Zs are a lot <strong>more aware</strong> about when they find<em> </em><strong><em>they are being taken advantage of</em>, <em>when it is time to leave a company</em>, <em>what all skills actually matter</em>, <em>the right compensation for their work</em> </strong>and<strong> <em>their ultimate goals in life</em></strong>.</p><p>Yes, <strong>online activism &amp; meeting online friends</strong> is a part of them because they were born during the <strong>era of Twitter &amp; Tinder</strong>.</p><p>Most of them never had to walk out of their homes to meet their friends, to play, communicate or even buy vegetables. So<strong>, they’ve had a lot less personal interaction than any previous generation</strong>.</p><p>Despite all these challenges, you have a generation which<strong> still believes and keeps it’s head high</strong> when tackling problems.</p><p><em>So, just be a little kind to them because the world hasn’t been.</em></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*ramntlrqukwOAwgWm5VTBQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@berko?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Ran Berkovich</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/believe-mural-painting-rLXU8ajlQ9Q?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=f3df065de3aa" width="1" height="1" alt="">
