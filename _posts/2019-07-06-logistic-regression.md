## Introduction
Logistic Regression is a **Supervised learning algorithm widely used for classification.** It is used to predict a **binary outcome (1/ 0, Yes/ No, True/ False) given a set of independent variables.** To represent binary/ categorical outcome, we use **dummy variables.**

Logistic regression uses an equation as the representation, very much like linear regression. It is not much different from linear regression, except that a **Sigmoid function** is being fit in the equation of linear regression.

## Simple Linear and Multiple Linear Regression Equation:

``
y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + e
``

Sigmoid function :

``
p = 1 / (1 + e ^ -(y))
``

Logistic Regression Equation :

``
p = 1 / (1 + e ^ -(b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 +... + e))
``

where,
p is the probability of outcome

y is the predicted output

b0 is the bias or intercept term

Each column in your input data has an associated b coefficient (a constant real value) that must be learned from your training data.

## Difference between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression :
- In Linear Regression the target is an **continuous (real value)** variable while in Logistic Regression the target is a **discrete (binary or ordinal)** variable.
- The Predicted values in case of Linear Regression are the **mean of the target variable** at the given values of the input variables. While the Predicted values in Logistic regression are the **probability** of a particular level(s) of the target variable at the given values of the input variables.

## Types of Logistic Regression:
1. **Binary Logistic Regression:** The target variable has **only two 2 possible outcomes.** For example, classifying e-mails as Spam or not Spam.
2. **Multinomial Logistic Regression:** The target variable **has three or more categories without ordering.** For example, predicting which food is preferred more (Veg, Non-Veg, Vegan)
3. **Ordinal Logistic Regression:** The target variable **has three or more categories with ordering.** For example, rating for a movie rating from 1 to 5.

## Decision Boundary
To predict which class a data belongs, a **threshold** can be set. Based upon this threshold, the obtained estimated probability is classified into classes. This threshold is called the **Decision Boundary.**

Say, if predicted_value â‰¥ 0.5, then classify email as spam else as not spam.
**Decision boundary can be linear or non-linear**. Polynomial order can be increased to get complex decision boundary.

## Advantages of Linear Regression :
1. It makes **no assumptions about distributions of classes** in feature space.
2. **Easily extended to multiple classes** (multinomial regression).
3. Natural probabilistic view of class predictions.
4. **Quick to train and very fast at classifying unknown records.**
5. Good accuracy for many simple data sets.
6. Resistant to overfitting.

## Disadvantages of Logistic Regression :
1. It **cannot handle continuous variables.**
2. If independent variables are not correlated with the target variable, then Logistic regression does not work.
3. **Requires large sample size** for stable results.

## Logistic Regression Assumptions :
1. Binary logistic regression **requires the dependent variable to be binary.**
2. Dependent variables are not measured on a ratio scale.
3. Only the meaningful variables should be included.
4. The **independent variables should be independent of each other.** That is, the model should have little or no multi-collinearity.
5. Logistic regression **requires quite large sample sizes.**
