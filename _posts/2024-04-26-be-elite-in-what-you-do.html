<p>Nobody can tell MS Dhoni to get off the cricket field saying he has retired from International Cricket for nearly 4
    years and can’t play no more. You just can’t find someone who is a better finisher and chaser than him in
    world cricket.</p>
<p>Nobody can say Cristiano Ronaldo to retire from playing football. After all these years, he is still among the
    highest goal-scorers in the world as compared to all the up and coming young players.</p>
<p>All of this is because they made it that way, they choose to be Great!</p>
<h3>Greatness is a Choice</h3>
<p>You choose to do something amazing not just by your words but by your actions. <strong>By showing up each and
        every day</strong>.</p>
<p>By grinding on days which were good and on days which were bad.</p>
<p>Whether your hard-work got you noticed or whether your hard-work got ignored.</p>
<blockquote>Be in the leagues of Elites because that is where the real magic happens.</blockquote>
<p>Not everyday you’re going to do great but it’s the average that counts.</p>
<h3>“There are levels to this” game of life</h3>
<p>The people at the <strong>highest levels of human performance are playing a whole different game</strong> because
    they <em>play the game differently</em> &amp; <em>play it better than anybody else.</em></p>
<p>Yes, sometimes what you do does go unnoticed, unappreciated, and not acknowledged but in that scenario be aware
    whether you need to improve or go some place where you are appreciated.</p>
<blockquote>Your environment either feeds you energy or saps the energy out of you.</blockquote>
<p>Knowing which is which is the whole ball game!</p>
<h3>Make ‘The Choice’</h3>
<p><strong>Don’t be afraid of taking matters into your own hands</strong> whether it be your career, life goals,
    ambition, relationships, education, etc.</p>
<p>By being responsible about what you say and choose to do, you exercise the most important tool provided to human
    civilization — <strong>Free Will.</strong></p>
<p>Choose a better career, a better job, a better college degree, better lifestyle and better environment to live
    and work.</p>
<p><strong>The trick is to never settle </strong>for what has been given to you but <strong>continue searching for what
        is best in you &amp; outside</strong>.</p>
