<h4>1. Dichotomy of Control</h4>
<p><em>Dichotomy of control</em> is about <strong><em>‘Controlling the Controllables’.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Control what you can and leave the rest. </em>Never give your <strong>‘freedom to choose’</strong> to
    anyone else.</p>
<blockquote>“We cannot control the external events around us, but we can control our reactions to them.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>— Epictetus</blockquote>
<p>Here’s one from Victor Frankl,</p>
<blockquote>“Everything can be taken from a man but one thing . . . to choose one’s attitude in any given set of
    circumstances.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>— Victor Frankl, Man’s Search for Meaning</blockquote>
<h4>2. Rule of Life</h4>
<p><em>Make it your life’s goal to ‘search for truth’.</em></p>
<blockquote>“Seek ye first the good things of the mind,” Bacon admonishes us, “and the rest will either be supplied or
    its loss will not be felt.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Truth will not make us rich, but it will make us free.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>— Will Durant</blockquote>
<h4>3. Facing Anxiety</h4>
<p><strong><em>Don’t suffer from ‘Imagined Troubles’.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>The one who suffers before it is necessary suffers twice.</em></strong></p>
<blockquote>Today I escaped anxiety. Or no, I discarded it, because it was within me, in my own perceptions — not
    outside.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>― Marcus Aurelius, Meditations</blockquote>
<p>this one is from Seneca,</p>
<blockquote>We suffer more in imagination than in reality</blockquote>
<blockquote>— Seneca</blockquote>
<h4>4. How to face Obstacles</h4>
<p>According to the stoics, our obstacles give us the opportunity to practice the 4 stoic virtues of <strong>wisdom,
        courage, temperance or moderation, and justice </strong>in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Stoic believe in <strong><em>living a life in accordance with nature</em>.</strong></p>
<blockquote>The impediment to action advances action, what stands in the way becomes the way.</blockquote>
<blockquote>— Marcus Aurelius</blockquote>
<h4>5. On Revenge</h4>
<p>Give up the feeling of revenge because <em>you’re going to inflict more pain to yourself.</em></p>
<p>The best form of revenge is to <strong>not be like them</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>The best revenge is to be unlike him who performed the injustice.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>— Marcus Aurelius</blockquote>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The Stoics believed that the <strong>practice of virtue</strong> is enough to achieve ‘<strong>Eudaimonia’ : a
        well-lived life</strong>.</p>
<p>The Stoic principles include <strong>living according to nature, controlling your perspective, managing expectations,
        negative visualization, re-framing, acceptance, and contemplating death.</strong></p>
<p>By living according to these principles, you will stress less about things that don’t matter and live your life to
    the fullest.</p>
