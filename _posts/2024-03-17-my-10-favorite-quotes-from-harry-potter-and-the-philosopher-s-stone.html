<h4>The boy who lived</h4><h4>From the book</h4><p>My favorite Quotes from Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s stone</p><blockquote>“The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror, that is, he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is.” — Albus Dumbledore</blockquote><p>Mirror of Erised, a magical object in the Harry Potter series, shows the deepest desires of a person’s heart.</p><blockquote>“It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.” — Albus Dumbledore</blockquote><blockquote>“There are all kinds of courage. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.” — Albus Dumbledore</blockquote><blockquote>“Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.” — Hermione Granger</blockquote><blockquote>“There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.” — Hermione Granger</blockquote><blockquote>“It is a monstrous thing, to slay a unicorn. Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself, and you will have a half-life, a cursed life, from the moment the blood touches your lips.” — Firenze</blockquote><blockquote>“After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.” — Albus Dumbledore</blockquote><blockquote>“The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.” — Albus Dumbledore</blockquote><blockquote>“Fame isn’t everything, is it, Mr. Potter?” — Severus Snape</blockquote><blockquote>“Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.” — Ron Weasley</blockquote><p>In the book, Harry’s first interaction with Draco Malfoy is at Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions in Diagon Ally.</p><p>During their short interaction (in which Draco had no idea who Harry was), the Malfoy family heir boasted his pure blood and made fun of Hagrid. Harry was not impressed.</p><blockquote>Draco: “You’ll soon find out that some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”</blockquote><blockquote>Harry: “I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.”</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*leLzHhIdglyxOSa5yQv8wg.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by B K on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=414e6a0c69d0" width="1" height="1" alt="">
