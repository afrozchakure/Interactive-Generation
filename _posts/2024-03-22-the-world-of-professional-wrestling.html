<h3>It’s Show Business</h3>
<p>To be real with you guys, I’m a huge wrestling fan.</p>
<p>No, I’m not that kid from school who doesn’t know that professional wrestling is scripted.</p>
<p>Well in turn, the only reason I love it so much is because<strong> I know it is scripted</strong>.</p>
<p>Things like the promos are ‘<strong>scripted</strong>’, story lines are ‘<strong>written</strong>’, the show is
    ‘<strong>planned</strong>’ and all the moves are ‘<strong>rehearsed</strong>’ between wrestlers before they come to
    the ring to actually ‘<strong>wrestle</strong>’.</p>
<p><strong>It is similar to watching a movie</strong>, you know the <strong>actors are acting and everything is
        planned</strong> but <strong>you always want to see how it ends</strong>.</p>
<p>While some of you might shrug off saying that you watch WWE TV !?</p>
<p>To them, I would say yes sometimes, but I’m more of an AEW, NJPW, Lucha Underground, Ring Of Honour (ROH) kind
    of guy.</p>
<p>what’s the difference you ask, let us begin!</p>
<h3>Case for Wrestling</h3>
<blockquote><em>Do you know that former US President, Donald Trump is in the WWE Hall of Fame?</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>Hollywood actor, Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson was an active WWE wrestler before his acting career took off
        and has a family lineage of Sports entertainers.</em></blockquote>
<p><strong>OR</strong></p>
<blockquote><em>Did you ever read in class that Abraham Lincoln was a professional wrestler in his youth?</em>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you even know that WWE has <strong>100+ million</strong> subscribers on YouTube and is the only 3rd channel from
    The United States to be in the <strong>Top 10 most subscribed channels in the world</strong>?</p>
<p>Last year, <strong>WWE merged</strong> with <strong>the UFC </strong>to form the <strong>TKO Group Holdings
    </strong>with a total market valuation of over<strong> $21.4 billion </strong>at that time!</p>
<p><strong>AEW ALL IN: London 2023</strong> sold <strong>81,035 tickets at Wembley Stadium, the largest paid crowd in
        wrestling history, and had an actual turnstile attendance of 72,265</strong> for a single show.</p>
<blockquote>The market for wrestling is crazy and I can go on &amp; on about how great the business is from Television
    rights, TV shows, Merchandise, Pay-Per-Views (PPVs), Live Events, Live Appearances, Brand deals, etc.</blockquote>
<p>Those who were a bit skeptical at first can begin to notice that it is a legitimate business that is on par and at
    most times performs better in some aspects than most ‘real’ sports leagues of the world, think of NBA, NFL, IPL,
    English Premier League, etc.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Business</h3>
<p>The wrestling business is <strong>quite similar to how our movies, soaps, and operas are structured.</strong></p>
<p>You have guys <strong>who are liked by the audience</strong> called <strong>Faces </strong>in the wrestling business,
    someone like John Cena and You have <strong>guys who are disliked by the crowd </strong>called
    <strong>Heels</strong>, an example being Randy Orton during his initial years of the<strong> Legend
        Killer gimmick</strong>.</p>
<p>All of the story lines are written so that the Faces (good guys) keep losing to Heels (bad guys) until at last they
    finally beat them and avenge their previous losses.</p>
<p><strong>That’s the entire business.</strong></p>
<p>Now other things are involved like <strong>Body Building</strong>, <strong>Acting </strong>(Selling), Being
    Entertaining, <strong>Cutting great Promos</strong>, Remembering specific move sequences during matches (spots),
    having great matches (5-star matches), Doing high flying / Hardcore spots, Bleeding, Getting Heat (making the
    audience hate you), Kayfabe, etc.</p>
<p>But those are things what wrestlers do daily.</p>
<p>Now, There are different styles of wrestling like <strong>‘High Flying Lucha Libre’ style </strong>popular in Mexico,
    <strong>‘Strong Style’</strong> wrestling popular in Japan, <strong>‘Hardcore Blood and Violence’</strong> popular
    in promotions like GCW, etc.</p>

<h3>Tough Business to Get into and Tough Business to stay in</h3>
<p>Behind the glamour of Wrestlemanias and All-Ins, it is easier to forget that <strong>not all wrestlers get to see
        themselves perform at the biggest stage</strong>.</p>
<p>Many give in to drug abuse, steroids, painkillers, depressants, etc. Although the industry has improved significantly
    in recent decades, it is important to remember that <strong>these Wrestlers are not unionized yet</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling Companies often end up taking advantage of these wrestlers</strong> and <strong>keep a majority of
        those profits to themselves</strong> and many of these <strong>wrestlers die early due to years of abuse
        inflicted</strong> on their bodies due to wrestling.</p>
<p>Although Wrestling is often presented as a scripted show, everything from falling inside the 4-sided ring (taking a
    bump) to taking high-flying risks on a glass top hurts and <strong>they get hurt &amp; bleed for real</strong>.</p>

<h3>Much more than a scripted sports</h3>
<p>Wrestling is best when it is presented as something larger than life. Something which the late Great Muhammad Ali
    learned early on in his career.</p>
<p>Muhammad Ali was often labeled as a <strong>“big-mouth and a bragger”</strong>, someone who would talk down his
    opponents and destroy them with his poetry which he often did so well on national television.</p>
<p>He writes in his autobiography <strong>‘The Greatest: My Own Story’</strong>, how he was inspired to trash talk by
    professional wrestler <strong>“Gorgeous George” Wagner</strong> after he saw <strong>George’s talking ability
        attract huge crowds to events</strong>.</p>
<h3>What News Media &amp; Politicians borrowed from Pro-wrestling</h3>
<p>If you see the news media and politicians today, you see <strong>how they rattle the audience by talking about topics
        that would make you angry, anxious, and disturbed.</strong></p>
<p>The reason is that <strong>once they have rattled the audience, people usually will stick around to see the end, lose
        their sense of common sense &amp; reasoning and they’ll become invested in their story either in terms of time
        or money</strong>.</p>
<p>Even when there is no end in sight, People will give up their time to find a good ending based on their prejudices.

<blockquote>“…it doesn’t matter if people love you or hate you, as long as they feel strongly one way or the other
    (business will be good!). The worst place you can be is in the middle.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>― Eric Bischoff, former WCW Executive President and Author of Book ‘Controversy Creates Cash’</blockquote>
