subtitle: The biggest mistake people make in work and life
---
<p>Titles are temporary, they can be taken away from you the same way they are given.</p><p>Don’t let your ego, ambition, self-worth, and pride get attached to what titles, roles and positions you are given by your company.</p><blockquote>There are no guarantees in life, only opportunities.</blockquote><h4>Things will change</h4><p>In life or work <strong>nothing remains the same.</strong></p><p>Just imagine 5 years ago how different things were or even 10 years ago where you lived, the technologies around that time &amp; how everything around you was different than today.</p><p><strong>Most of the things in life have a transient nature. They change.</strong></p><p>You’re job is to keep moving forward, <strong>never be complacent or become comfortable</strong>.</p><h4>Nothing to be Proud of</h4><blockquote>If God has given you a lot, it has given it to you to serve the people around you.</blockquote><p>There is nothing to be pompous, proud or even have an Ego about what you’ve been given.</p><p>A lot in life depends upon luck. Yes, hard-work &amp; perseverance are a factor but a lot in life depends on luck.</p><h4>Don’t dance till the music is on</h4><p>Instead of attaching your self-worth to your company, find &amp; identify yourself as a person.</p><blockquote>What are your strengths, weaknesses, your goals, what things work for you, things you like / dislike, person you would like to become and what things really define you as a person?</blockquote><p>Identify things that can never be taken away from you, like where you come from, your upbringing, your childhood, the environment you grew up in, etc.</p><p>Let those things drive every decision in your life because <strong>no one can take those things away from you ever</strong>!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*WE1nzuQp7mVdq0ht5MHHzQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@lightphonics?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Jamie Brown</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-smiling-near-tree-outdoor-during-daytime-wm4DuvIpLj8?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=e955927cd2ca" width="1" height="1" alt="">
