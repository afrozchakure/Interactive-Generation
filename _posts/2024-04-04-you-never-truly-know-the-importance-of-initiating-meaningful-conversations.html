<p>You know what’s the real tragedy in life,</p><blockquote>You will sit working in an office next to someone for years and never have the courage to have a one-on-one conversation with them.</blockquote><p>You wouldn’t even ask them their name and where they are from.</p><h4>It is difficult to start a conversation</h4><p>If you’re an introvert or a bit reserved, it is very difficult to start conversations with someone you don’t know the first time.</p><p>There was a survey conducted where people were asked,</p><p><strong>“What is their worst fear?”</strong></p><blockquote>‘Public Speaking’ topped the list, ‘Death’ was the Runner-up.</blockquote><p>Meaning people would rather be in the ‘Casket’ than deliver the ‘Eulogy’.</p><blockquote>It takes tremendous Courage to go and talk to a person for the first time.</blockquote><blockquote>Secret lies in not thinking too much about it and just doing it.</blockquote><h4>Be In The Same Room with the Person</h4><p>I think the best to understand somebody is not to be in an office, board-room or playground.</p><blockquote>The best place is to sit with them in a room and talk about random things.</blockquote><blockquote>Some topics will be interesting, some will be bad but you would get an idea about what that person thinks and feels.</blockquote><p>Here’s how my trips to my coaching class for studies helped me understand people better:</p><blockquote>I used to stay with my friends for nearly 12 hours each day in a small class room where we would study from 9 am to 9 pm and then return home.</blockquote><blockquote>In between we would take breaks and go to attend lectures if those were scheduled.</blockquote><blockquote>We would discuss problems, resolve doubts, talk about random topics, and would often eat together during our breaks.</blockquote><blockquote>Some would crack jokes and all of us would laugh, some would share their funny fantasies about life after cracking JEE — How they wanted their lives to turn out, things they want to do, places they wanted to visit, people they wanted to meet, etc.</blockquote><blockquote>I learnt an important lesson in human interaction — <strong>You’ve got to walk in other people’s shoes to understand a person.</strong></blockquote><p>I think the most I got to learn about existing alongside other people was during that phase of my life.</p><h4>Understanding People is Hard!</h4><blockquote>People are different, they have hidden egos, insecurities, abilities, strengths, weaknesses, beliefs, agendas, etc.</blockquote><p>It’s very difficult to grasp why some behave the way they behave until you’ve seen the world through their eyes.</p><p><strong>You have got to talk to their soul</strong>, until then you are just talking to someone who is least bothered about you.</p><h4>Take Initiative</h4><p>Here <strong>is ‘How to Avoid Regret in life?</strong>’ —</p><blockquote>Be the first one to talk and initiate the conversation. That way you would gain confidence in your abilities to talk and have a discussion.</blockquote><blockquote>The more you feel afraid, the less you should think.</blockquote><blockquote>Practice it a few times and let it become your Second Nature.</blockquote><p>People often think “Positive emotions lead to Positive action” but <strong>often “Positive actions lead to Positive emotions in your life”</strong>.</p><blockquote>Remember you have got to act for your life to be a success!</blockquote><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*1-trM2qecI2gk2WXIOpiQw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@goodspleen?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Alexandre Chambon</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/woman-sitting-on-window-2vmcCcy6sGo?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=92bf2b1b72d0" width="1" height="1" alt="">
