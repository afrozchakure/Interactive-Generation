Here's a list of books that have helped me over the years. This list is for me to keep track of what I've read and what I'm reading, so these are not recommendations in any way. 

But feel free to reach out if you have any suggestions or comments. Cheers.

For Finance and Entrepreneurship

Sadly, money is not taught in schools. Schools focus on scholastic and professional skill, but not on financial skills. Therefore, it becomes very important to teach students not just to work for money but to have money work for them. The following books are great for setting the foundation of your financial success.

- Think and Grow Rich by Napolean Hill.
- Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert T. Kiyosaki.
- Zero to One by Peter Thiel. ( It more like a startup manuscript but helpful nonetheless)
- Made in America by Sam Walton 
- Shoe Dog by Phil Knight 
- Total Recall by Arnold Schwarzenegger

Philosophy 

- The Story of Philosophy by Will Durant 
- The greatest minds and ideas of all time by Will Durant 
- Letters from a Stoic by Seneca. 
- Beyond Good and Evil by Friedrich Nietzsche.
- The Republic by Plato. 
- Man’s Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl.
- Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Yuval Noah Harari
