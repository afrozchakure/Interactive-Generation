My personal blog where I share my insights about technology, productivity, and books. I'm an avid reader and have read most of my share of books during my college days. I'm often fascinated by the value people are able to create by doing simple things in effective ways. I started blogging back in 2017 and posted a few blogs on my [wordpress.com site][wordpress], some of those blogs were later re-published on sites like [Hacker Noon][hackernoon], [Medium][medium], and [GeeksforGeeks][gfg]. 

A lot of these blogs have been read by over 200,000 people from around the globe. Although I like publishing on other platforms, I often found it difficult to control the distribution of my content. This website is an attempt to resolve all that. You will find some of my previous content here along with some new ones. 

So if you want to learn more, you can consider subscribing to my RSS feed using an RSS reader like [Feedly][feedly]. I do plan to write more often now and will be exploring some newer technologies, productivity habits, and ideas from books in this blog.

## Why the name Interactive Generation?

A little story ... 

I had always been a big fan of flash-based games and I remember playing them almost every day when I was a kid. Back in 2008, I got my first computer which was an LG Pentium dual-core system having 1 GB ram with Windows Vista installed üò¨ (later I installed XP, so no worries there XD ), the only games that you could play on it were flash-based and a few low spec ones. One of the CD games, I had bought that same year contained a demo version of a game by an English indie Game developer named [Mat Dickie][mdickie] popularly known as "mdickie". The game although a demo was quite enjoyable and I might have played it for 3 years straight. 

Later in 2011, I got my first internet connection through a 2G dongle from Reliance (the speed was shitty). Anyways, I was able to find his site through a google search and able to download the full version of the game (which is quite remarkable considering the internet speeds at that time). His games although not as polished as those made by THQ Inc. were quite advanced for their age and not only that the game felt real with great storylines and graphics. 

By then he had retired from making games in 2009 and had released a book called `"Inspiration for the Interactive Generation"`. The idea for the blog's title came from the book. This being a technology and productivity blog, the title seemed to fit, and lets be honest I'm a big fan of that guy. 

Mat came out of retirement in 2012 and has been making games ever since. Most notably his game [Wrestling Revolution 3D][wrevolution] released that year has been downloaded more than 100 million times on Play Store and is considered the No. 1 Mobile Wrestling Game ever beating games build by giants like WWE. It is quite remarkable that a single person can achieve such a feat when a multi-billion dollar public company cannot. 

Again this comes back to what I said in beginning, `Create value by doing simple things in effective ways`.
